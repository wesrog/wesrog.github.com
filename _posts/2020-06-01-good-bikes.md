After a good run, we let some bikes go to other homes.<!--more-->

I'm an admirer of good photography. And when I see beautiful pictures of bicycles, I often wonder if I could do the same. While these photos aren't nearly the quality of pros out there, I am pretty happy with how they turned out and I think they helped when selling. If the picture looks good, you are more likely to get interested people.

### Fairdale Archer Weekender

First up was Colleen's second bike, a 2017 Fairdale Weekender. This was her first real commuter bike and it held up really well over 3 years and several hundred miles. A woman who was slightly taller than Colleen picked it up and it fit her perfectly. I think it was actually a little too large for Colleen.

### Bianchi Pista Fixed Gear

This Bianchi Pista was my first _real_ bike. Before this bike, I was graciously gifted a Raleigh touring frame that was about 8cm too large for me. When I found this frame and fork on craigslist, it had all the decals removed and it was the perfect size for me. At the time, fixed gear bikes were all the rage especially for me in Florida where most of the landscape is flat. It totally made sense then. Nowadays, I'm riding more mixed terrain and this bike didn't see as much action. So, it was time to part. The downside, and a hard lesson for me to learn was that I ended up leaving this bike outside during a winter in our apartment on Overton where we didn't have room to store it inside. So there were a few rust spots. The kind gentleman that picked it up didn't seem to mind. And I actually ended up giving him a deal since he mentioned he was a restaurant worker that was out of work during the Covid-19 pandemic.

### Farewell, good bikes!

These bicycles have been with us for a few years and they served us really well. We are happy that they are going to people who will breathe new life into them and give them more miles out on the roads.
