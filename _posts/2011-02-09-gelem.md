I donâ€™t remember any specifics about this song. The only thing I can think of
when I play it is how annoyed I was with the ending bassline. I ended up
leaving it as it was, maybe thinking that I would fix it later.

This is post #1 of a reposting of some of my old tracks that I am digging up. I
will be posting more tracks every day or so. Stay tuned?
