I spent an entire weekend installing Linux on my Lenovo Yoga 11s. I could’ve
halved that time if I had just bit the bullet and installed Ubuntu. But, I had
to first try Arch (kinda the reason I wanted to get a Linux laptop in the first
place), then when the realtek wifi drivers wouldn’t work, I tried debian and
then the drivers _still_ didn’t work so I just went with Ubuntu and compiled
drivers from

The touchscreen stuff isn’t quite there yet. Touching the screen acts just like
using the cursor. So, it’s pretty difficult to touch some areas since it’s so
precise.

This laptop is still really new so the info is a little scarce. I think the Yoga
11s has similar hardware to the Yoga 13, so most posts on the Yoga 13 should
apply to the 11s.

Oh, and I LOVE this laptop. It’s so light and portable. My first impressions
with the battery are average. I’d say I got a good solid 4 hours compiling,
browsing, etc. Need to do more testing to see how long it lasts while idle or
just with light usage.
