Colleen and I just finished the Fremont Express route for Portland's 2019 Bridge
Pedal. It was a blast! Just around 40 miles or so total, out and back. I took my
Lilac Polyvalent and Colleen took her All-City Space Horse. I would do it again,
but it was kind of crowded in some parts, so I might opt for a more leisurely
ride on some backroads with my camping gear with me.

## Route

Here's the route we took. This includes the ride to the starting point and back.
It also includes a brunch stop off at Sweedeedee.
