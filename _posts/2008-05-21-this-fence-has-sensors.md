I was at the PNS airfield because it's a really lovely, quiet little back road
to bike down.<!--more--> As I'm there, the sun is setting, planes are flying
in, and it's a great opportunity to take some pictures with my d40.

Little did I know that when I was propping up my bike on the fence, it set off
some alarms. Some nice folks came by and kindly told me to leave :) So I did.
But, I was happy to get some great pictures!

I thought it was funny that the "No Trespassing" sign is in this picture I
took. Oops.
