If you aren't familiar with Ezra Caldwell, he is most recently known
(posthumously) for the bikes he fabricated.<!--more-->I remember seeing
pictures on the late fffound of super clean, minimal, and beautifully built
bicycles with wooden fenders and subsequently stumbled on Fast Boy Cycles. It
was then that I became even more obsessed wih bikes and building my dream bike.

I started reading more about who Ezra is and learned that he also took amazing
photographs and also had a stint in dancing. He unfortunately passed away from
cancer in 2014. I still have some of the wooden fenders he made; they feel
really special to me. His works (both bicycles and photography), his story, and
his philosophy of life remain an inspiration to me today.

One of my favorite quotes from him is:

> We remember pieces of history by the wars and the art.

You can find that quote in this interview from the Photographic Journal.
