If you aren't familiar with Ezra Caldwell, he is most recently known for
(posthumously) the bikes he fabricated. I remember seeing pictures of super
clean, beautifully built bicycles with wooden fenders and stumbled on Fast Boy
Cycles. It was then that I became even more obsessed wih bikes.<!--more-->

I started reading more about who Ezra is and learned that he passed away from
cancer. His works (both bicycles and photography) remain an inspiration to me
today.

One of my favorite quotes from him is:

> We remember pieces of history by the wars and the art.

You can find that quote in this interview from the Photographic Journal.
