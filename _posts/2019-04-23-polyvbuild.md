I'm building my own bike from parts! Not the actual frame, as some people
thought. Also, I did not build the wheels. Jim at Gladys Bikes built them which
I am super happy how they turned out.

I made several trips to Universale Cycles to pick up parts. I tried to do it all
by bike.

I learned a lot throughout this process, like how to install a headset using a
headset press:

What was funny about this was at the time, I did not have a car accessible to
me. So I biked my frame up to the bike shop. It definitely elicited some stares.

I was told that I should definitely use some frame saver to prevent rust. The
guy at Kenton cycles was nice enough to let me borrow a can since a little bit
goes a long way.

I didn't take too many photos of the build process, but here's how it turned
out!
