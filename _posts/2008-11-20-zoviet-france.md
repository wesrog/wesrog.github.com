I was unaware that zoviet france ceased creation of music. Rapoon is his new
alias and I’m hooked. Dark ambient similar to Robert Rich, Biosphere (Geir
Jennsen) and Steve Roach. It’s delectable. Perfect background music with a
feeling that leaves you isolated and cold on a desolate plain.

I was about to purchase a bunch of Rapoon’s album on iTunes, but found out that
magnatune had most of it. So, I purchased a monthly subscription which is
honor-based. I felt $40 would be sufficient for all the Rapoon I wanted.
Unbenounced to me was the plethora of other collections and genres available on
magnatune. It’s very independent-based and half of the proceed go directly to
the artists, which I like. I like knowing that the money I’m spending will help
these artists out so they can continue to infiltrate my audio space.

Rapoon is simply amazing. Right up there with Biosphere, and that’s hard to
compete against.
