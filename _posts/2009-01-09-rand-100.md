So, you’re chatting with a friend over IM or email and you’ve decided that
you’re going out for drinks (or dinner or something). You’ve also decided that
you want to carpool. Who’s to drive? An easy way out is to just say “you drive”.
Another way out is to use yubnub with the random generator command and roll your
way to an unbiased answer!<!--more-->

Get your rand on:
[http://random.org/cgi-bin/randnum?num=1&min=1&max=100&col=1](http://random.org/cgi-bin/randnum?num=1&min=1&max=100&col=1)

If you have yubnub working in your browser, simply type: “rand 100” in the
address bar and you’re good to go. Don’t have yubnub setup? [go
here](http://www.633k.net/2006/04/keyboard-kowboy-fun-with-yubnub-and.html). If
you’re one of the few that do not have easy access to yubnub, simply send this
URL to a friend additionaly visiting it yourself to get your random number.
Whoever comes closest to 100 gets to drive! Problem solved! Don’t cheat.
Seriously. Treat it like a game of D&D.

I was hoping Google would have included this in their plethora of query commands
(calculator, etc), but alas, they did not have any sort of random generator that
I could find.

Now, if only yubnub was as universally accepted and used as Google, we might be
a little happier.
