I finally got a chance to participate in World Listening Day. The year prior, a co-worker told me about it and organized a walk around Portland. I very much wanted to go, but had prior obligations. This year, I was able to make it! So, I invite you to go on a walk with me around downtown Portland during an epidemic.

This was recorded with a Zoom H6 with stereo X/Y mic with a dead cat, although it was particularly windy that day.
