Hi, I'm Wes.

I love writing elegant, efficient, and sensible code that is mirrored with
functional and intuitive design. My work is best paired with a UX Designer as I
love bringing life into human-centered designs.

I have been writing software and designing websites since the early 2000s. I
became a manager of engineers around 2014 and have been practicing that
discpline now for almost 6 years. Alongside that, I work on projects at home to
keep my skills fresh.

Here, you'll find a multitude of musings ranging from the technical to the
frivolous.

You'll also occassionally find music that I make here as well.
