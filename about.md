Well, hello there! This is the dumping ground of Wes's thoughts and musical
compositions. It's very unlikely you'll find anything useful here and frankly,
if you're reading this, I'm sorry.

You'll also occassionally find music that I make here as well.

## About me
![me](/assets/me.jpg)

I have been "writing software" since the early 2000s. I have now been a manager
of software engineers since 2014 or so and try to keep up with writing software
on the side when inspiration strikes me or when I'me excited by new technology.
