Hi, I'm Wes.

I love writing elegant, efficient, and sensible code that is mirrored with
functional and intuitive design. My work is best paired with a UX Designer as I
love bringing life into designs.

My professional experience ranges from full-stack to technical leadership. I
have built multiple teams ranging in various technical disciplines as well as
full fledged web applications.

Here, you'll find a multitude of musings ranging from the technical to the
frivolous.

You'll also occassionally find music that I make here as well.

## About me
![me](/assets/me.jpg "A picture of me smiling and holding a coffee mug that says
'Poe me a cup'")

I have been writing software and designing websites since the early 2000s. I
became a manager of engineers around 2014 and have been practicing that
discpline now for almost 6 years. Alongside that, I work on projects at home to
keep my skills fresh.
